The cashier register is a boring computer designed for efficiency. The
Dynabook, both software and hardware, wants to bring this efficiency
to teachers and students to manage their job of teaching and learning.

The Dynabook App is the main user application of the Dynabook
device. It is through this app that teachers and students interact the
most. Its features are interconnected to maximize user comfort and to
save time. It anticipates the needs of the user according to their
location and time of use, at home, school, in which class, and with
which students.

The pedagogical documents are based on hand annotated pdf documents
(with a stylus) and interactive Morphs plugged in when needed. These
documents are organized in topics and binders. The plugged Morphs are
retrieved from existing libraries or user coded, both are Smalltalk
written.

The administrative contents are organized in objects described in the
Objects chapter, Administrative section. The pedagogical objects are
described in the Pedagogical and Document sections.
