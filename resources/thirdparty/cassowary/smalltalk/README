This directory contains files for a Smalltalk implementation of Cassowary.  

This Smalltalk implementation is released to the public domain.

A990112.dat is a configuration map for Version 4.46 of Cassowary 
(12 January 1999).  If you are using OTI Smalltalk use this.

Otherwise you can try using the following fileout files:
    ClKernel.app -  the kernel application
    ClTests.app - some small test examples
    ClDemos.app - some graphical demos
You will probably need to make some changes to run these under different
implementations of Smalltalk -- the kernel and the tests will probably port
without too much trouble; the graphical demos would need to be redone.


Here are some statements to execute to open up the graphical demos:

(ClBinaryTreeDemo height: 5)  open.
ClBoxesDemo new open.
ClElasticQuadDemo new open.
ClBoundedQuadDemo new open.
ClQuadDemo new open.
ClBoundedLineDemo new open.
ClLineDemo new open.
