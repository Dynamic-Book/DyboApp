# Title
Dybo, the cash register of education
A **Dy**namic **bo**ok for education

# Why the Dybo project? (description)
## Problem
At present time, in XXIe centuries, students and teachers are still mostly operating on an analog paper-pen base environment, mostly because of the ubiquitous nature of this setting. It results in still heavy and some time huge bags for the learner, particularly the younger ones at secondary I. When digital environments are used it is most of the time cumbersome, fragmented, non ubiquitous, lacking interactivity, closed source with few liberties to extend the system, non dedicated hardware and few added value for the local economy.

## Solution
Our project takes a software and hardware approaches to bring efficiency to teachers and students to manage their job of teaching and learning. We want the same efficiency observed in other sectors of the economy benefiting of the digital transition.

We use the analogy of the cash register, a streamlined computer designed for efficiency within a restricted context, to emphasis the importance of both dedicated software and hardware carefully designed to improve the teaching and learning experiences of educators and learners.

# What it offers? (key features)
## Software
The Dybo application provides both business[1] and pedagogical means to improve the user experience of learning and teaching. Putting out anxiety from the persons improves their wellness and ability to conduct tasks. The Dybo application is developed in Cuis-Smalltalk, it ensures rapid prototyping, agile development, portability to different hardware architecture, step-by-step control by the user.

The application operates under a GNU/Linux system providing the needed third-party supports.

* **Business.** It is through this app that teachers and students interact the most. Its features are interconnected to maximize user comfort and to save time. It anticipates the needs of the teacher or student according to their location and time of use, at home, school, in which class, and with which collaborators.

* **Pedagocial.** The educational documents are based on hand annotated pdf documents (with a stylus) and dynamic knowledge model objects plugged in when needed. These teaching documents are organized in topics and binders. The plugged models are retrieved from existing libraries of scripts, used as is or edited by the user with the Smalltalk programming language. 

## Hardware
The Dybo hardware overall look is a digital analogy of a 24x32 (cm) textbook designed for longevity with following features:
* handwriting on one or two of its screens, may be one e-ink screen and one color screen
* RISC V architecture at best or alternatively ARM 
* Cylinder battery cells
* Easy to reaper 

The interim Dybo will have a different settings. Its purpose is to explore the concept with prototypes build with off-the-shell component.

# Why it's open and free?
Both free software and hardware makes the Dybo easier to adapt to
local needs: freedom to modify, to update, to repair and to assemble.

Administrating a fleet of free software systems proved to be easier by avoiding undocumented features often found in proprietary systems. There are no such things as shadowed area in free software and hardware.
 
# Why join?
## Users
While it is both a software and hardware project, the Dybo application can be installed on your own device, preferably a GNU/Linux system to enjoy all its  features.

## Developers
Join an exciting project where you can gain tremendous experiences in agile software development[2], GNU/Linux system, hardware design and prototyping with the interim Dybo.

# How to get involved?
We welcome Smalltalk and GNU/Linux system developers, educators,
designers and testers. Visit our Dybo GitHub organisation.

# Community
The Dybo project is build by enthusiastic persons for whom the values of free software and hardware are central. We cherish agile development thanks to our Cuis-Smalltalk development system. With this system we explore new way to design both end-user applications and dynamic knowledge models for the educators and the learners. 

Moreover, by essence our development models make these end-user software learnable, modifiable and driven by script. We truly believe in empowering the end-user by providing the right environment and tools.
