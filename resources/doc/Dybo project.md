# Title
Dybo, the cash register of education
A **Dy**namic **bo**ok for education

# Description
## Problem
At present time, in XXIe centuries, students and teachers are still mostly operating on an analog paper-pen base environment, mostly because of the ubiquitous nature of this setting. It results in still heavy and some time huge bags for the learner, particularly the younger ones at secondary I. When digital environments are used it is most of the time cumbersome, fragmented, non ubiquitous, lacking interactivity, closed source with few liberties to extend the system, non dedicated hardware and few added value for the local economy.

## Solution
Our project takes a software and hardware approaches to bring efficiency to teachers and students to manage their job of teaching and learning. We want the same efficiency observed in other sectors of the economy benefiting of the digital transition.

We use the analogy of the cash register, a streamlined computer designed for efficiency within a restricted context, to emphasis the importance of both dedicated software and hardware carefully designed to improve the teaching and learning experiences of educators and learners.

# Key features

## Software

The Dybo application provides both business[1] and pedagogical means to improve the user experience of learning and teaching. Putting out anxiety from the persons improves their wellness and ability to conduct tasks. The Dybo application is developed in Cuis-Smalltalk, it ensures rapid prototyping, agile development, portability to different hardware architecture, step-by-step control by the user.

The application operates under a GNU/Linux system providing the needed third-party supports.

* **Business.** It is through this app that teachers and students interact the most. Its features are interconnected to maximize user comfort and to save time. It anticipates the needs of the teacher or student according to their location and time of use, at home, school, in which class, and with which collaborators.

* **Pedagocial.** The educational documents are based on hand annotated pdf documents (with a stylus) and dynamic knowledge model objects plugged in when needed. These teaching documents are organized in topics and binders. The plugged models are retrieved from existing libraries of scripts, used as is or edited by the user with the Smalltalk programming language. 

## Hardware

The Dybo hardware overall look is a digital analogy of a 24x32 (cm) textbook designed for longevity with following features:
* handwriting on one or two of its screens. 
* RISC V architecture at best or alternatively ARM 
* Cylinder battery cells
* Easy to repear 

The interim Dybo will have a different settings, likely only on screen
